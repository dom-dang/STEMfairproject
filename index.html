    <h1>Deciding on Deicers: Measuring the Efficiency of Deicers and Their Environmental Effects!</h1>
    
    <p>
      The United States utilized approximately 15 billion kilograms of road salt during the
winter of 2013-2014. Massachusetts averages about 44 inches of snow each year, and requires
vast amounts of road salt for winter storm preparation. While rock salt is affordable and
commonly used to de-ice roads, it does not work under temperatures below -7°C, poses a hazard
to the environment by raising salinity levels of nearby bodies of water, and releases unwanted
compounds like lead, iron, and cadmium into the ecosystem. Recently, many cities are veering
away from rock salt and experimenting with other alternatives including calcium chloride and
beet juice. However, there is no “perfect” deicing substance on the market today because there
are many needs for one product. While some products are environmentally friendly, they are
expensive and hard to manage at home and while others are inexpensive, they corrode
automobiles and create slick conditions. As a result, the main goal is to find the best product
depending on preference to cost, availability, environmental effects, toxicity, and effectiveness in
low temperatures. This project’s findings would help raise awareness and mindfulness of road
salt usage and impact on the environment, as well as alternate deicing solutions. In addition, the
findings could help scientists and local governments further research the chemicals used as
deicers and the consequences they have on nature.
