    <h1>
      Deciding on Deicers: Measuring the Efficiency of Deicers and Their
      Environmental Effects
    </h1>

    <p>
      The United States utilized approximately 15 billion kilograms of road salt
      during the winter of 2013-2014. Massachusetts averages about 44 inches of
      snow each year, and requires vast amounts of road salt for winter storm
      preparation. While rock salt is affordable and commonly used to de-ice
      roads, it does not work under temperatures below -7°C, poses a hazard to
      the environment by raising salinity levels of nearby bodies of water, and
      releases unwanted compounds like lead, iron, and cadmium into the
      ecosystem. Recently, many cities are veering away from rock salt and
      experimenting with other alternatives including calcium chloride and beet
      juice.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this project, <b>beet extract </b>was proven the most efficient at
      melting ice. Beet extract melted an average of 8.1 mL of water per 15
      minutes, compared to 6.6 mL by calcium chloride and 5.5 mL by the control.
      Additionally, beet extract deicer had the least impact on plant
      germination. After 12 days of germination, the average grass length of
      seeds germinated in the beet extract solution was 2.54 cm as compared to
      2.69 cm from water control. CMA’s average length of grass was 2.26 cm,
      ranking second. Findings from this project would help spread awareness and
      mindfulness of road salt usage and impact on the environment, and at the
      same time, address the need for further research by scientists and
      governments to find the best and perfect deicer that currently does not
      exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there is no “perfect” deicing substance on the market today
      because there are many needs for one product. While some products are
      environmentally friendly, they are expensive and hard to manage at home
      and while others are inexpensive, they corrode automobiles and create
      slick conditions. As a result, the main goal is to find the best product
      depending on preference to cost, availability, environmental effects,
      toxicity, and effectiveness in low temperatures. This project’s findings
      would help raise awareness and mindfulness of road salt usage and impact
      on the environment, as well as alternate deicing solutions. In addition,
      the findings could help scientists and local governments further research
      the chemicals used as deicers and the consequences they have on nature.

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    <h4>Why did you choose this project?</h4>
    <p>
      I wanted to find out if the commonly used rock salt could perform as well
      as new deicers such as beet extract deicer and calcium magnesium acetate
      (the green or purple deicers you see on the sidewalk nowadays). As a
      native Bostonian, I have had my fair share of snowstorms and blizzards and
      seen mountains of deicers either on the road, in buildings, and in my
      garage.
    </p>
    <h4>From the photos, why does the grass grown in rock sand so tall?</h4>
    <p>
      This is most likely because of the dirt particles in the rock sand used in
      the experiment. Since rock sand is not technically a deicer (it does not
      use the colligative property to melt ice), it was used more as a control
      to compare grass growth with other deicers. You might also notice in the
      box-and-whisker plot, the number of grass grown in the NaCl concentration
      was one of the highest number, however, the majority of the grass grown
      were below the median and were shortest in length compared to grass grown
      in other deicer solutions.
    </p>
    <h4> Why are there no error bars on some of the graphs? And the graphs that do have error bars, why are they so large?</h4>
    <p>
      Most graphs do not have error bars because when experimenting, I tested a
      different day for each Set which resulted in different environments such
      as room temperature (which is why the error bars are so large) Including error bars in most of the graphs would
      serve no function because it would not accurately represent the data.
    </p>
    <h4> How was Massachusetts Region V High School Science & Engineering Fair? </h4>
    <p>
       It was a great experience! I met new people and learned about new science and technology that is being researched and discovered as we speak!
