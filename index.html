    <h1>
      Deciding on Deicers: Measuring the Efficiency of Deicers and Their
      Environmental Effects
    </h1>

    <p>
      The United States utilized approximately 15 billion kilograms of road salt
      during the winter of 2013-2014. Massachusetts requires vast amounts of
      road salt for winter storm preparation because the state alone averages
      about 44 inches of snow each year. While rock salt is affordable and
      commonly used to de-ice roads, it does not work under temperatures below
      -7°C, poses a hazard to the environment by raising salinity levels of
      nearby bodies of water, and releases unwanted compounds like lead, iron,
      and cadmium into the ecosystem. Recently, many cities are veering away
      from rock salt and experimenting with other alternatives including calcium
      chloride and beet juice.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this project, the deicing efficiency of 5 deicers: sodium chloride,
      calcium chloride (2 traditional deicers), calcium magnesium acetate (CMA),
      beet extract deicer (2 new deicers), and rock sand (control) was tested by
      measuring the amount of ice melted for every 15 minutes. The impact of
      these deicers on plant germination was also tested on grass seeds by
      measuring the grass length and counting the number of seeds grown on petri
      dishes. The hypotheses are: calcium chloride would be the most efficient
      deicer, melting the largest volume of ice within a certain amount of time
      and CMA would be the most environmental friendly deicers that seeds
      germinated in CMA would have the longest length.
    </p>

    <p>
      My hypothesis was proven incorrect. From my project, I found that
      <b>beet extract </b> was the most efficient at melting ice. Beet extract
      melted an average of 8.3 mL per 15 minutes, compared to CaCl2 which melted
      an average of 7.2 mL and the control which melted an average of 6.3 mL.
      Additionally, <b> beet extract </b> had the least impact on plant
      germination. After 12 days of germination, the average grass length of seeds germinated in
      the beet extract solution was 2.54 cm while the control average length was
      2.69 cm. The average length of grass grown in CMA was 2.26 cm, the second
      closest length to the control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, there is no “perfect” deicing substance on the market because
      there are many must-have characteristics for one product. While some
      products are environmentally friendly, they are expensive and hard to
      manage at home and while others are inexpensive, they corrode automobiles
      and create slick conditions. As a result, the main goal is to find the
      best product depending on preference to cost, availability, environmental
      effects, and effectiveness in low temperatures. This project’s findings
      would help raise awareness and mindfulness of road salt usage and impact
      on the environment, as well as alternate deicing solutions. In addition,
      the findings could help scientists and local governments further research
      the chemicals used as deicers and the consequences they have on nature.

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    <h4>What are the key findings of your project?</h4>
    <p>
      <b>Beet extract </b> was the most efficient at melting ice and has the
      least effect on plant germination. CMA is also efficient and
      friendly to the environment, however, cost and availability makes it hard for
      homeowners and governments to switch to using these environmentally
      friendly deciers. Findings from this project would help spread awareness and
      mindfulness of road salt usage and impact on the environment, and at the
      same time, address the need for further research by scientists and
      governments to find the best and perfect deicer that currently does not
      exist.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Why did you choose this project?</h4>
    <p>
      As a native Bostonian, I have had my fair share of snowstorms and
      blizzards and seen mountains of deicers either on the road, in buildings,
      and in my garage. I wanted to find out if the commonly used rock salt
      could perform as well as new deicers such as beet extract deicer and
      calcium magnesium acetate (the green or purple deicers you see on the
      sidewalk nowadays).
    </p>
    
    <h4> What would you do differently if you was given more time or resources? </h4>
    <p>
      If I were to repeat this experiment and was given more time or resources,
      I would test with larger samples and conditions more closely related to
      daily life such as in parking lot, garage, streets or lawns. My
      experiments were done indoors with the heat on, at a comfy room
      temperature. Additionally, I would test with a more controlled
      environment. An observation made during testing was that some ice in the
      containers were frozen on a slant and that affected the melting rates.
      With more resources, I would test with other common deicers such as urea
      and potassium a
      cetate.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Why did you choose the concentration for the deicer solutions?</h4>
    <p>
      I originally began with a 0.2 concentration for the decicing solution. However, after 12 days of plant germination, none of the seeds grown in the chemical deicers had grown; only the grass in the control and rock sand grew. 
      From that, I did some research and learned about the limit of sodium chloride in water regulated by the FDA 
    </p>

    
    <h4>Why was rock sand used a control?</h4>
    <p>
      Rock sand is not technically a deicer because it does not use the
      colligative property to melt ice; instead, it is commonly used to increase
      traction on the sidewalks. Rock sand was used more as a control to compare
      grass growth with other deicers. Grass grown in the rock sand solution
      also had the longest average length. This is most likely due to the dirt
      or soil particles mixed in the rock sand used in the experiment. You might
      also notice in the box-and-whisker plot, the number of grass grown in the
      NaCl concentration was one of the highest number, however, the majority of
      the grass grown were below the median and were shortest in length compared
      to grass grown in other deicer solutions.
    </p>
    
    <h4>
      In terms of data analysis, why are some graphs lacking error bars and
      those that do - have very large error bars?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Most graphs do not have error bars because the experiments were performed
      during different days and times, in different environments. Those of which
      are uncontrolled to model day-to-day weather fluctuations throughout the
      winter. Therefore, it is not practical to use averages, standard
      deviations, and error bars to represent the data.
    </p>
    
    <h4>
      What was your experience at the Massachusetts Region V High School Science
      & Engineering Fair?
    </h4>
    <p>
      It was a great experience! I met a lot of people, made new friends, and
      had the opportunity to learn about their projects. New science and
      technology as well as their applications were amazing and fascinating to
      discover. Below is a picture of my high school's participants after the
      award ceremony.
