    <h1>
      Deciding on Deicers: Measuring the Efficiency of Deicers and Their
      Environmental Effects
    </h1>

    <p>
      The United States utilized approximately 15 billion kilograms of road salt
      during the winter of 2013-2014. Massachusetts averages about 44 inches of
      snow each year, and requires vast amounts of road salt for winter storm
      preparation. While rock salt is affordable and commonly used to de-ice
      roads, it does not work under temperatures below -7°C, poses a hazard to
      the environment by raising salinity levels of nearby bodies of water, and
      releases unwanted compounds like lead, iron, and cadmium into the
      ecosystem. Recently, many cities are veering away from rock salt and
      experimenting with other alternatives including calcium chloride and beet
      juice. However, there is no “perfect” deicing substance on the market
      today because there are many needs for one product. While some products
      are environmentally friendly, they are expensive and hard to manage at
      home and while others are inexpensive, they corrode automobiles and create
      slick conditions. As a result, the main goal is to find the best product
      depending on preference to cost, availability, environmental effects,
      toxicity, and effectiveness in low temperatures. This project’s findings
      would help raise awareness and mindfulness of road salt usage and impact
      on the environment, as well as alternate deicing solutions. In addition,
      the findings could help scientists and local governments further research
      the chemicals used as deicers and the consequences they have on nature.
