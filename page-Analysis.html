    <h1>Analysis & Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
      Note: both are very similar only differing in citations and about a
      paragraph. The general message is the same but the analysis includes more
      numbers, data, and comparision while the conclusion is a general summary
      of the experiment and includes future applications.

    <h3>Analysis of Data</h3>
    <p>
      The final results of the two experiments proved both hypotheses
      <b> incorrect</b>. I hypothesized that if five different deicers: sodium
      chloride, calcium chloride, calcium magnesium acetate, rock sand, and beet
      extract were tested for their efficiency to melt ice, then calcium
      chloride would be the most efficient one, melting the largest amount of
      ice in a certain amount of time. My second hypothesis was if the length of
      grass were measured after the seeds germinated in different deicing
      solutions, then the seeds germinated in calcium magnesium acetate would
      have the longest length. Pertaining to the results from the first
      experiment, the <b> beet extract deicer </b> performed most efficiently,
      with a final average of 8.3mL, compared to calcium chloride, with a final
      average of 6.9mL. For the second experiment, <b> beet juice </b> had the
      least effect on plant germination. The average grass length of seeds
      germinated in the beet extract solution was 2.54 cm while the control
      average length was 2.69 cm. Calcium magnesium acetate average length of
      grass was 2.26cm which was the second closest length to the control.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first experiment, the beet extract deicer used was mixed with CMA
      and other common deicers, which increased melting capability. CMA
      performed second best overall because different from NaCl, CMA releases
      heat when going into a water solution instead of absorbing heat, which
      speeds up melting (Dunn and Schenk, 1979). According to a review written
      by D. Kelting and C. Laxon, CMA has little to no effects on vegetation,
      which the hypothesis was based on. Beet juice had the least effect on
      plant germination because of its ingredient makeup. Desugared molasses
      from beet juice is often discarded after the useful sugar is removed (U.S.
      Patent No. 6416684B1, 2001). Beet juice itself is non-corrosive and
      environmentally friendly (Gerbino et al, 2012). When beet juice is
      combined with other deicers, a smaller amount of chemicals is needed to do
      the same amount of work, resulting in a smaller environmental impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      To improve the experimental design, a more practical environmental
      setting, such as parking lots, highways, lawns or gardens is needed.
      Factors such as temperature, weather, and road conditions, would produce
      more precise data pertaining to the efficiency of the deicing substances.
      An experiment conducted by S.M. Kamal Hossain, Liping Fu, and Roberto Lake
      tested in parking lots without traffic effects and temperature conditions
      were in the effective range of rock salt or -9°C. Alternatives, such as a
      blend of salt and other proprietaries, outperform rock salt but only in
      certain conditions (Hossain et al., 2015).

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      The final results of the two experiments proved <b>both hypotheses incorrect. </b>
      I hypothesized that if five different deicers: sodium chloride, calcium
      chloride, calcium magnesium acetate, rock sand, and beet extract were
      tested for their efficiency to melt ice, then calcium chloride would be
      the most efficient one, melting the largest amount of ice in a certain
      amount of time. My second hypothesis was if the length of grass were
      measured after the seeds germinated in different deicing solutions, then
      the seeds germinated in calcium magnesium acetate would have the longest
      length.

      The experiment’s results are conclusive, indicating that the beet juice
      deicer is the most efficient in melting ice and has the least effect on
      plant germination. According to a review written by D. Kelting and C.
      Laxon, calcium chloride works efficiently in the lowest temperatures and
      is exothermic, which releases heat when melting ice. CMA has little to no
      effects on vegetation, which the second hypothesis was based on. However,
      when CMA gets absorbed by soil, its microbes will break down the acetate
      ions and deplete oxygen levels which can impact plant life (Charola et
      al., 2017).

      The United States utilized approximately 15 billion kilograms of road salt
      during the winter of 2013-2014 while Massachusetts averages about 44
      inches of snow each year, and requires vast amounts of road salt for
      winter storm preparation. Currently, the “best” deicer does not exist
      because all different deicing substances have their advantages and
      disadvantages. Many alternatives with promising solutions have been
      proposed such as CMA and beet juice, however cost and availability made it
      hard for governments to switch to using environmentally friendly deicers.
      While CMA has little to no adverse effects on the environment, it costs
      about 30 times more than NaCl by the ton. Additionally, while beet juice
      is cost-effective and efficient, the production is only in certain parts
      of the United States. Homeowners also have to decide on the best deicer
      that suits most, if not all, of their needs. As snowfall comes earlier
      year by year, the need for an environmentally friendly solution becomes
      more pressing. This project’s findings would help <b> raise awareness and
      mindfulness of road salt usage and impact on the environment, as well as
      alternate deicing solutions. </b> In addition, the findings could help
      scientists and local governments further research the chemicals used as
      deicers and the consequences they have on nature.

      An experiment that helped greatly during the creation of this experiment
      was conducted by Guoju Ke, Jun Zhang, and Bo Tian. Their experiment
      included spraying grass with concentrations of deicers and measuring the
      amount of days until the tips of the grass turned yellow (Ke, Zhang, Tian,
      2019). Their concentration amounts helped me further my research into
      deciding what concentration should Experiment II have to plant
      germination. To improve the experimental design, a <b>more practical
      environmental setting </b>, such as parking lots, highways, lawns or gardens is
      needed. Factors such as <b> temperature, weather, and road conditions, </b> would
      produce more precise data pertaining to the efficiency of the deicing
      substances. To further these experiments, I would try to create new
      deicers or a combination of common deicers to find a solution for a deicer
      anybody can use easily without harming the environment.
