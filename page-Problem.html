    <h1>Problem & Hypothesis</h1>
    
    <h3> Problems </h3>
    <p>
      What are the pros and cons of the commonly used deicing substances: road salt, calcium chloride, calcium magnesium acetate, beet extract, and rock sand? How effective are they on snow and ice melting? What are 
      their effect on rate of melting compared to each other? What effect do different deicing substances have on grass growth?
    </p>
    <h3>  Hypotheses</h3>
    <p>
      If five different deicers: sodium chloride, calcium chloride, calcium magnesium acetate, rock sand, and beet extract were tested for their efficiency to melt ice, then calcium chloride would be the most efficient one, 
      melting the largest amount of ice in a certain amount of time 
    </p>
    <p>
      If the length of grass were measured after seeds germinated in different deicer solutions, then the seeds germinated in calcium magnesium acetate would have the longest length
