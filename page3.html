    <h3> How do deicers work in the first place?</h3>
    <p>
      There are two major kinds of deicing chemicals on the market today: organic chemicals with potassium acetate and chlorate (Dai et al., 2012). Organic chemicals are efficient non-corrosive but expensive 
      to use as a complete solution (Dai et al., 2012). Deicing depends on the properties of solutes to lower the melting point when dissolved (Dunn and Schenk, 1979). The lower the molecular weight, the lower 
      the freezing point will decrease (Dunn and Schenk, 1979). Chlorate, which include sodium chloride (NaCl) and calcium chloride (CaCl2) and generally called deicing salts, is low cost but produces increased 
      breakage (Dai et al., 2012).

    <h3> What are the environmental effects of deicing salts? </h3>
    <p>
      Ice and snow can melt faster using deicing chemicals but there are serious consequences for the environment from excessive use. Chemicals in melted snow can make their way into the soil by surface water or
      underground water and stay there, polluting the environment (Dai et al.,2012). These chemicals could also get absorbed by plants and impact plant growth, as well as absorbed by particles in the air and get 
      transported to a new location (Dai et al., 2012). Other environmental effects of deicers include changing the physical and ecological properties of lakes, polluting drinking water by increasing salinity, 
      damaging the ozone layer, and disturbing the balance in plant cells. Sodium chloride is responsible for the corrosion of bridges, road surfaces, vehicles, and the damage to vegetation and aquatic systems 
      (Amrhein, Strong, & Mosher, 1992). During the winter of 2002 in Beijing, many people spread large quantities of deicing chemicals to melt all the snow. The next spring, over 300 thousands living green fences 
      died. According to Dai (2012), “After testing the left snow near (the) main roads and soil around the injured or dead plants, it was found that salt content in soil was 392 times higher than the normal value.”
      Canadian and northeastern US states also measured sodium content in well reservoirs at levels 2-140 times the recommended limit for people (Amrhein et al., 1992). As a result, many more alternatives to NaCl have
      been found and commercially used.
