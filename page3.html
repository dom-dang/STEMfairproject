    <h3> How do deicers work in the first place?</h3>
    <p>
      There are two major kinds of deicing chemicals on the market today: organic chemicals with potassium acetate and chlorate (Dai et al., 2012). Organic chemicals are efficient non-corrosive but expensive 
      to use as a complete solution (Dai et al., 2012). Deicing depends on the properties of solutes to lower the melting point when dissolved (Dunn and Schenk, 1979). The lower the molecular weight, the lower 
      the freezing point will decrease (Dunn and Schenk, 1979). Chlorate, which include sodium chloride (NaCl) and calcium chloride (CaCl2) and generally called deicing salts, is low cost but produces increased 
      breakage (Dai et al., 2012).

    <h3> What are the environmental effects of deicing salts? </h3>
    <p>
      Ice and snow can melt faster using deicing chemicals but there are serious consequences for the environment from excessive use. Chemicals in melted snow can make their way into the soil by surface water or
      underground water and stay there, polluting the environment (Dai et al.,2012). These chemicals could also get absorbed by plants and impact plant growth, as well as absorbed by particles in the air and get 
      transported to a new location (Dai et al., 2012). Other environmental effects of deicers include changing the physical and ecological properties of lakes, polluting drinking water by increasing salinity, 
      damaging the ozone layer, and disturbing the balance in plant cells. Sodium chloride is responsible for the corrosion of bridges, road surfaces, vehicles, and the damage to vegetation and aquatic systems 
      (Amrhein, Strong, & Mosher, 1992). During the winter of 2002 in Beijing, many people spread large quantities of deicing chemicals to melt all the snow. The next spring, over 300 thousands living green fences 
      died. According to Dai (2012), “After testing the left snow near (the) main roads and soil around the injured or dead plants, it was found that salt content in soil was 392 times higher than the normal value.”
      Canadian and northeastern US states also measured sodium content in well reservoirs at levels 2-140 times the recommended limit for people (Amrhein et al., 1992). As a result, many more alternatives to NaCl have
      been found and commercially used.

    <h3> What are the altneratives? </h3>
    <p>
      One promising solution is calcium magnesium acetate (CMA). While NaCl has sodium ions present, CMA does not, which produces little to none corrosive effects (U.S. Patent No. 4664832A, 1984). Although, CMA takes
      20-30 minutes to start melting snow, it is longer lasting that road salt and only needs to be applied once in 12 hours (Kelting & Laxson,2010). However, when CMA gets absorbed by soil, its microbes will break down 
      the acetate ions and deplete oxygen levels which can impact plant life (Charola et al., 2017). Similarly, oxygen depletion could happen in slow moving streams and small ponds where the acetate ions could migrate 
      (Charola et al., 2017). Additionally, CMA is associated with low molecular weight alkaline earth salts produced from waste by alkaline fusion (Dunn and Schenk, 1979). Different from NaCl, CMA releases heat when 
      going into a water solution instead of absorbing heat, which speeds up melting (Dunn and Schenk, 1979). Purified CMA is often applied with NaCl which works to increase traction if the solution is unable to
      work through a sheet of ice (Dunn and Schenk, 1979). If CMA is taken without purification, traction improves meaning that a purification step is potentially not needed. This could lead to a better CMA deicer at a
      lower cost. Although CMA has positive environmental effects, the deicer is produced by classical chemical methods using pure chemicals (U.S. Patent No. 4664832A, 1984) which results in expensive costs. Some 
      suggestions have been made for CMA to made in a crude form of acetic acid by reacting cellulose with an inorganic base, however, this process produces significant amounts of oxalic acid which is toxic to humans
      (U.S. Patent No. 4664832A, 1984).

    <p>
      Another promising solution is beet juice from desugared sugar cane molasses. Desugared molasses from beet juice is often discarded after the useful sugar is removed (U.S. Patent No. 6416684B1, 2001). Minnesota
      Department of Transportation started to use beet juice as a deicer from the large industry in the Red River Valley of Minnesota and the need of re-use of sugar beet waste (Charola et al., 2017). Typically, beet
      juice syrup is mixed with traditional salt, sand, or chloride brines (Charola et al., 2017). Beet juice is readily soluble as well as improves the properties of other deicers (U.S. Patent No. 6416684B1, 2001). 
      When beet juice is combined with other deicers, a smaller amount of chemicals is needed to do the same amount of work, resulting in a smaller environmental impact. Beet juice itself is highly effective at
      temperatures below 0°C and is non-corrosive and environmentally friendly (Gerbino et al., 2012). It does not harm vehicles or outdoor structures and similarly to CMA, when combined with other deicing compounds, beet
      juice reduces the corrosiveness of the solution (U.S. Patent No. 6416684B1, 2001). Scientists are also researching other waste products as an alternative to combine with NaCl. Residues of distilled or fermented 
      agricultural products like corn, barely, and pickle brine or other ideas like wet corn milling, wine, and cheese-making are potential solutions to cost effective alternatives.
