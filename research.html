    <h3>Why are deicers important?</h3>
    <p>
      The United States utilized approximately fifteen billion kilograms of road
      salt during the winter of 2013-2014. The removal of snow has evolved over
      the years from mechanical approaches such as shoveling and plowing to
      heating to chemical methods, including deicing substances (U.S. Patent No.
      4664832A, 1984). Deicers, which are based on lowering the freezing point
      of water, are applied after snow events (Charola, Rousset, & Bläuer,
      2017). There is no “perfect” deicing substance on the market today because
      there are numerous needs for one product, including solubility with water,
      efficient in low temperatures, long-lasting, convenient, cost effective,
      and reliable (U.S. Patent No. 6416684B1, 2001). While some products are
      environmentally friendly, they are expensive and hard to manage at home
      and while others are inexpensive, they corrode automobiles and create
      slick conditions.

    </p>

    <p>
      From a statewide perspective, total economic impact also plays a role in
      deciding the type of deicing substance to use (U.S. Patent No.4664832A,
      1984). The US Environmental Protection Agency published data stating that
      the cost of damage from using sodium chloride rock salt for highway
      deicing is about 15 times the actual cost of purchasing and applying the
      salt in the first place (U.S. Patent No. 4664832A, 1984). Additionally,
      the environmental impacts of many deicing substances on the market today
      are substantial and can cause corrosion, slick conditions on the road, and
      water pollution (Dai, Xhang, Xu, & Yu, 2012). As a result, the main goal
      is to find the best product depending on preference to cost, availability,
      environmental effects, toxicity, and effectiveness in low temperatures.
    </p>
    <h3>How do deicers work in the first place?</h3>
    <p>
      Freezing point depression is a type of colligative property: a physical
      property that is not dependent on size, mass, or other parts of the solute
      particles in a solution (World of Chemistry, 2000). A freezing point of a
      solution is when the temperature of vapor pressure is equal to the
      temperature of the solid. Adding a substance that does not easily
      evaporate into gas into the solvent will lower the vapor pressure and
      consequently, lower the temperature where the vapor pressure of the liquid
      and solid is equal (World of Chemistry, 2000). For example, as salt
      dissolves in water as a deicer, it lowers the freezing point of water
      several degrees, preventing ice from forming on the streets (World of
      Chemistry, 2000).
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two major kinds of deicing chemicals on the market today:
      organic chemicals with potassium acetate and chlorate (Dai et al., 2012).
      Organic chemicals are efficient non-corrosive but expensive to use as a
      complete solution (Dai et al., 2012). Deicing depends on the properties of
      solutes to lower the melting point when dissolved (Dunn and Schenk, 1979).
      The lower the molecular weight, the lower the freezing point will decrease
      (Dunn and Schenk, 1979). Chlorate, which include sodium chloride (NaCl)
      and calcium chloride (CaCl2) and generally called deicing salts, is low
      cost but produces increased breakage (Dai et al., 2012).

    <h3>What are the environmental effects of deicing salts?</h3>
    <p>
      Ice and snow can melt faster using deicing chemicals but there are serious
      consequences for the environment from excessive use. Chemicals in melted
      snow can make their way into the soil by surface water or underground
      water and stay there, polluting the environment (Dai et al.,2012). These
      chemicals could also get absorbed by plants and impact plant growth, as
      well as absorbed by particles in the air and get transported to a new
      location (Dai et al., 2012). Other environmental effects of deicers
      include changing the physical and ecological properties of lakes,
      polluting drinking water by increasing salinity, damaging the ozone layer,
      and disturbing the balance in plant cells. Sodium chloride is responsible
      for the corrosion of bridges, road surfaces, vehicles, and the damage to
      vegetation and aquatic systems (Amrhein, Strong, & Mosher, 1992).

    </p>

    <p>
      During the winter of 2002 in Beijing, many people spread large quantities
      of deicing chemicals to melt all the snow. The next spring, over 300
      thousands living green fences died. According to Dai (2012), “After
      testing the left snow near (the) main roads and soil around the injured or
      dead plants, it was found that salt content in soil was 392 times higher
      than the normal value.” Canadian and northeastern US states also measured
      sodium content in well reservoirs at levels 2-140 times the recommended
      limit for people (Amrhein et al., 1992). As a result, many more
      alternatives to NaCl have been found and commercially used.
    </p>
    <h3>What are the alternatives?</h3>
    <p>
      One promising solution is calcium magnesium acetate (CMA). While NaCl has
      sodium ions present, CMA does not, which produces little to none corrosive
      effects (U.S. Patent No. 4664832A, 1984). Although, CMA takes 20-30
      minutes to start melting snow, it is longer lasting that road salt and
      only needs to be applied once in 12 hours (Kelting & Laxson,2010).
      However, when CMA gets absorbed by soil, its microbes will break down the
      acetate ions and deplete oxygen levels which can impact plant life
      (Charola et al., 2017). Similarly, oxygen depletion could happen in slow
      moving streams and small ponds where the acetate ions could migrate
      (Charola et al., 2017). Additionally, CMA is associated with low molecular
      weight alkaline earth salts produced from waste by alkaline fusion (Dunn
      and Schenk, 1979). Different from NaCl, CMA releases heat when going into
      a water solution instead of absorbing heat, which speeds up melting (Dunn
      and Schenk, 1979).
    </p>
    <p>
      Purified CMA is often applied with NaCl which works to increase traction
      if the solution is unable to work through a sheet of ice (Dunn and Schenk,
      1979). If CMA is taken without purification, traction improves meaning
      that a purification step is potentially not needed. This could lead to a
      better CMA deicer at a lower cost. Although CMA has positive environmental
      effects, the deicer is produced by classical chemical methods using pure
      chemicals (U.S. Patent No. 4664832A, 1984) which results in expensive
      costs. Some suggestions have been made for CMA to made in a crude form of
      acetic acid by reacting cellulose with an inorganic base, however, this
      process produces significant amounts of oxalic acid which is toxic to
      humans (U.S. Patent No. 4664832A, 1984).

    <p style="font-size: 13px;">
      Source: https://www.deeproot.com/blog/blog-entries/deicing-with-beet-juice
    </p>

    <p>
      Another promising solution is beet juice from desugared sugar cane
      molasses. Desugared molasses from beet juice is often discarded after the
      useful sugar is removed (U.S. Patent No. 6416684B1, 2001). Minnesota
      Department of Transportation started to use beet juice as a deicer from
      the large industry in the Red River Valley of Minnesota and the need of
      re-use of sugar beet waste (Charola et al., 2017). Typically, beet juice
      syrup is mixed with traditional salt, sand, or chloride brines (Charola et
      al., 2017). Beet juice is readily soluble as well as improves the
      properties of other deicers (U.S. Patent No. 6416684B1, 2001). When beet
      juice is combined with other deicers, a smaller amount of chemicals is
      needed to do the same amount of work, resulting in a smaller environmental
      impact. Beet juice itself is highly effective at temperatures below 0°C
      and is non-corrosive and environmentally friendly (Gerbino et al., 2012).
    </p>
    <p>
      It does not harm vehicles or outdoor structures and similarly to CMA, when
      combined with other deicing compounds, beet juice reduces the
      corrosiveness of the solution (U.S. Patent No. 6416684B1, 2001).
      Scientists are also researching other waste products as an alternative to
      combine with NaCl. Residues of distilled or fermented agricultural
      products like corn, barely, and pickle brine or other ideas like wet corn
      milling, wine, and cheese-making are potential solutions to cost effective
      alternatives.
    </p>
    <h3>If there are such alternatives why don't more people switch?</h3>
    <p>
      Currently, the “best” deicer does not exist. All different deicing
      substances have their advantages and disadvantages. Scientists are
      researching chemicals in relation with infrastructure, roads, bridges, and
      environment to find multiple solutions to the increasingly widespread
      issue of deicing substances’ impact on the environment. NaCl is effective
      at lowering the freezing point of water however NaCl breaks down soil
      structure and could contaminate drinking water (Kelting & Laxson, 2010).
    </p>
    <p>
      Many alternatives with promising solutions have been proposed such as
      calcium magnesium acetate and beet juice, however cost and availability
      made it hard for governments to switch to using environmentally friendly
      deicers. While CMA has little to no adverse effects on the environment, it
      costs about 30 times more than NaCl by the ton. Additionally, while beet
      juice is cost-effective and efficient, the production is only in certain
      parts of the United States. Homeowners also have to decide on the best
      deicer that suits most, if not all, of their needs. While some deicers are
      animal and eco friendly, they could create dangerous conditions on the
      roads. If homeowners purchase a cost-effective solution, corrosion could
      occur on cars and sides of houses. The search for the perfect deicer still
      continues statewide and in everyday homes. As snowfall comes earlier year
      by year, the need for an environmentally friendly solution becomes more
      pressing. Innovative solutions such as installing heated solar panels on
      roads present promising results yet lack the funding to continue. Maybe
      scientists should not be looking for the perfect deicing substance but
      rather a combination of the most cost-effective, reliable, and
      environmentally friendly deicing substances.
